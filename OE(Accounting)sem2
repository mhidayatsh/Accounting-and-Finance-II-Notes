What is Investment?
Investment refers to the allocation of money, time, or resources into assets, projects, or ventures with the expectation of generating future income or profit. In economic terms, investment typically means the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used to create future wealth, such as capital goods or financial instruments.
In simple terms, investment means putting money to work with the aim of earning returns over time.

Elements of Investment
The main elements of investment are:

Q4: Characteristics of Bonds with Its Types (6 Points)

What is a Bond?
A bond is a fixed-income security that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower, typically a government or corporation. In return, the issuer pays regular interest and returns the principal amount on maturity.

Characteristics of Bonds (6 Points)
1. Fixed Interest (Coupon Rate):Bonds offer a pre-determined interest rate, known as the coupon, paid at regular intervals (usually annually or semi-annually).
2. Maturity Period:Bonds are issued for a specific duration after which the principal is repaid to the bondholder.
3. Face Value (Par Value):The bond has a fixed face value, usually ₹100 or ₹1,000, which is the amount repaid at maturity.
4. Tradability:Most bonds are tradable in financial markets, meaning investors can buy or sell them before maturity.
5. Credit Rating:Bonds carry credit ratings by agencies like CRISIL or ICRA, indicating the risk level associated with the issuer.
6. Priority in Repayment:In case of liquidation, bondholders are paid before shareholders, making bonds a safer investment compared to stocks.

Types of Bonds
1. Government Bonds:Issued by the central or state government. Considered very safe.
2. Corporate Bonds:Issued by private or public companies to raise capital. Higher risk than government bonds but may offer better returns.
3. Convertible Bonds:These bonds can be converted into equity shares of the issuing company after a certain period.
4. Zero-Coupon Bonds:These do not pay periodic interest. Instead, they are issued at a discount and redeemed at face value on maturity.
5. Municipal Bonds:Issued by local government bodies or municipalities to finance public projects.


Q5: What are Debentures and State Its Types

What is a Debenture?
A debenture is a type of long-term debt instrument issued by companies to borrow money from the public. It is not backed by any physical asset or collateral but is supported only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer.
In simple terms, a debenture is a loan certificate issued by a company that promises to pay interest and return the principal amount after a fixed period.

Features of Debentures:
* Fixed interest rate (coupon)
* Redeemable after a specific time
* No ownership rights (unlike shares)
* Can be secured or unsecured

Types of Debentures:
1. Secured Debentures:Backed by the company’s assets as collateral. If the company fails to pay, assets can be sold to repay investors.
2. Unsecured Debentures (Naked Debentures):Not backed by any security. These rely entirely on the issuer's creditworthiness.
3. Convertible Debentures:Can be converted into equity shares after a certain period, as per the terms set at the time of issue.
4. Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs):Cannot be converted into shares. Investors get only interest and principal repayment.
5. Redeemable Debentures:Repaid by the company on a pre-determined date or after a certain time period.
6. Irredeemable Debentures (Perpetual):Not repayable during the company’s lifetime. Only interest is paid regularly; principal may be repaid during liquidation.
